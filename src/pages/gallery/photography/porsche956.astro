    name="Porsche 956"
    info="Porsche created the 956 for the World Endurance Championship in 1982. It represented a new generation of race cars with pioneering technology such as its fuel-efficient 2.6-litre turbo engine and fully synchronised five-speed gearbox. The new Group C regulations stipulated a specific ratio of overall length to wheelbase in order to prevent the use of massive long-tail designs. In response, the 956 boasted the longest wheelbase of any Porsche race car to date at 265 centimetres. For the first time, Porsche developed a monocoque chassis constructed of sheet aluminium. Diffusers generated low pressure under the car which sucked the 956 to the track surface. This technology was new for sports prototypes and increased the cornering speeds considerably, giving Porsche a decisive advantage over the competitors. The debut at Le Mans yielded a triple victory, and factory driver Jacky Ickx went on to win the Sports Car World Championship. The 956 and its successor model the 962 C dominated the endurance racing field right through to the end of the 1980s."
